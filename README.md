# Memory Game MemoMash

## Game Dynamics

This memory game is implemented in Java and focuses on providing a dynamic and engaging gaming experience. The following aspects contribute to the dynamic nature of the game:

- **Randomization:** The game dynamically shuffles the placement of cards at the start of each round, ensuring a unique and challenging experience for players.

- **Scoring System:** A dynamic scoring system is in place to track and display the player's performance. Scores are calculated based on factors such as the number of moves and time taken to complete the game.

- **Responsive UI:** The user interface adapts dynamically to different screen sizes, providing a seamless gaming experience across various devices.

## Game Mechanics

The memory game follows a set of mechanics to create an enjoyable and challenging experience for players:

- **Matching Pairs:** The primary objective is to match pairs of cards with identical symbols. Players need to rely on their memory to remember the positions of cards and make successful matches.

- **Turn-based Gameplay:** Players take turns flipping two cards at a time. If the flipped cards form a pair, they remain open; otherwise, they are flipped back, and the player's turn is retained.

- **Game Progression:** The game dynamically adjusts its difficulty by increasing the number of cards or introducing new symbols as players advance through levels.

## Game Elements

The memory game comprises the following essential elements:

- **Cards:** Each card in the game represents a unique symbol. Cards are dynamically arranged at the beginning of each round, and players aim to match pairs.

- **Scoreboard:** A dynamic scoreboard tracks the player's progress, displaying relevant information such as the current score, number of moves, and elapsed time.

- **Levels:** The game may consist of multiple levels, each progressively more challenging than the last. Levels introduce new symbols or increase the number of cards, adding complexity to the gameplay.

- **Timer:** A dynamic timer keeps track of the time elapsed since the start of the game. This adds an element of urgency and challenges players to complete the game quickly for a higher score.
